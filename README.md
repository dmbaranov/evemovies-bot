## Introduction

Hello, let me introduce you Eve - your indispensable helper in a world of movies!

How many times has it happened to you that you wanted to watch a movie once it's available online but in the end you simply forgot about that? I guess quite often! That's why Eve exists! She'll remind you once the movies you're watching for are available and you can watch them!
